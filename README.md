# Storage

## Storage filling program

This program calculates the most efficient storage positions for a given number of boxes of different dimensions with a given storage unit.

## Input

The program waits for standard input in the following format:

5	7

2

7

2	2

3	4

4	2

3	2

1	2

2	5

2	2

2	1

3	1

Where the first two numbers are the size of the storage, the second two numbers are the count of the columns and the boxes. After that are the coordinates of the columns and the sizes of the boxes in each line.

## Output

The programs writes the filled storage to the standard output. The boxes are identified by numbers which represent the order that they came in.

Here is an example output:

4	4	4	4	4	5	5

4	4	4	4	4	5	5

1	1	1	1	2	2	2

1	1	1	1	2	2	2

7	7	7	3	3	6	6
